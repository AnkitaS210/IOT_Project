# IOT based automatic saline level monitoring system
This project is designed as an IOT solution for automated saline level monitoring in medical infusion systems.
An IoT-based automatic saline level monitoring system is a cutting-edge healthcare solution that utilizes the Internet of Things (IoT) technology to ensure precise and real-time monitoring of saline solution levels in medical equipment, such as IV (intravenous) drip systems. 
This system typically consists of sensors, a microcontroller, and a network connection to collect and transmit data.
An IoT-based automatic saline level monitoring system offers a sophisticated and convenient solution for healthcare facilities to enhance patient care, reduce manual monitoring efforts, and optimize resource management in the context of intravenous saline therapy.
